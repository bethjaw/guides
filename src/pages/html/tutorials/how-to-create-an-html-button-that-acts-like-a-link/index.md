## How to Create an HTML Button That Acts Like a Link

Sometimes you may want to use a button to link to another page or website rather than submitting a form, etc.  This is fairly simple and can be done in a few ways.

One way is to simply wrap your <button> tag in an <a> tag:
```html
<a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/'><button>Link To freeCodeCamp</button></a>
```
This allows your entire button to be a link. 

A second option is to create your link as you normally would with your <a> tag:
```html
  <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/'>Link To freeCodeCamp</a>
```
Once you've create your link, you can the use CSS to style your link to look like a button.  Possible CSS styling could include adding a border, background color, and hover.
